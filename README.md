# CoviGuard

This application is built keeping in mind all the functionalities a user might and will need if this was to go in production. CoviGuard is a platform for Covid related updates and alerts for the people of New York. Users will be able to create circles and add their friends, colleagues, or relatives to multiple groups which would open them to information like Covid cases among their family and friends. It allows the user to view Covid cases in the state of New York through a number of interactive graphs and maps. Users will be kept motivated through streaks for updating their locations regularly. Register today for a power packed application that helps you stay safe and fight against Covid.

## Functionalities

### Home Page
The first step towards becoming a CoviGuardian is visiting the application and signing up if you haven't done that yet. The rest of the features are just a few basic steps away.

### Dashboard
One of the major highlight of this project is a place where the users can see all their circles, map of the entire state and how badly has it been affected. All this would be available on the dashboard. This makes it easy for the user to navigate between 2 major functionalities in a jiffy.

### Circles
This being one of the main funtionalities allows the users to create and join circles. Users would be able to add and request the admin to join the circles. Circles allow users to keep a tab on all the members in the circles and get to know about their vaccination status and compliances. Furthermore, we have also given a feature to share the circle link with other users.

### Self Tracking
This is the feature that allows the user to track if going to a location is safe or not. This would take users (ones you've met) and locations as the input. This input is will further be editable as one can meet a number of users during the day. On entering the details for the first time in the day the user is provided with a streak which keeps a track of the number of days the user has been providing this information. This is our way of keeping the user engaged and motivated for a bigger cause.

### Monitor
This alows the user to track the number of cases in the state and his work & home location through various types of interactive graphs. These graphs can be altered in terms of choosing different counties, customising the dates for which you want to track the cases and choosing one of the five types of graphs offered for a better understanding of the data.

### Alerts
The name is sufficient to understand what this functionality does. Yes, it provides the user with realtime alerts about what is happening within their circles, which area is safe to visit and which area has the highest recorded covid cases.

### Notifications
This notifies the user about any pending request they need to accept or reject as an admin. Also notifies them if they are compliant with all the policies of the circles they are part of.

### Settings Page
This is the page where the user can make changes to his profile. From changing their name, work & home location, their vaccination status and a profile picture of their choice if they dont like the randomly generated display picture. 
Furthermore, provacy can be changes. This includes vaccination status, people they met and the locations they last visited which may be needed by some circles to declare the user compliant. Finally the user can make changes to their password from here too.
